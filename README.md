# hybrid-enterprise-lab
Simulated hybrid enterprise lab environment with on-prem Active Directory, Azure AD Connect, Microsoft 365 services, backup, SCCM, DNS, DHCP, and more.


This project is a fully virtualized hybrid enterprise IT lab. It includes an on-premises environment with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), DNS, DHCP, SCCM, and Veeam Backup, fully integrated with Microsoft 365 and Azure AD via Azure AD Connect. 

The goal is to replicate the type of environment commonly found in mid-to-large businesses, and gain hands-on experience with critical technologies such as user management, identity synchronization, endpoint management, and cloud services integration.

Built entirely with virtual machines, this lab provides a safe and flexible space to learn, practice, and demonstrate IT support, sysadmin, and cloud admin skills.
