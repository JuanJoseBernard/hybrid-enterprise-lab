# Hybrid Enterprise IT Lab Environment

This project simulates a fully virtualized hybrid enterprise IT environment combining on-premises infrastructure with cloud services.

---

## Overview

The lab includes an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment with DNS, DHCP, SCCM, and Veeam Backup & Replication servers. It is integrated with Microsoft 365 and Azure AD via Azure AD Connect for identity synchronization and cloud management.

---

## Purpose

Designed to replicate the core infrastructure typically found in mid-to-large organizations, this lab provides hands-on experience with:

- User and group management in Active Directory
- Device management using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune and SCCM)
- Hybrid identity synchronization with Azure AD Connect
- Cloud collaboration and licensing in Microsoft 365 (Teams, SharePoint, Exchange)
- Backup and recovery processes with Veeam B&R
- Core network services (DNS, DHCP)

---

## Setup

All components run as virtual machines connected via an internal virtual network, enabling full communication and service integration.
